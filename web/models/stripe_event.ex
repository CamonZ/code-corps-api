  Represents a reference to single Stripe API Event object

  ## Fields

  * `endpoint` - "connect" or "platform"
  * `id_from_stripe` - Stripe's `id`
  * `status` - "unprocessed", "processed", or "errored"

  ## Note on `status`

  When the event is received via a webhook, it is stored as "unprocessed".
  If during processing, there is an issue, it is set to "errored". Once
  successfuly processed, it is set to "processed".

  There are cases where Stripe can send multiple webhooks for the same event,
  so when such a request is received, an event that is "errored" or "unprocessed"
  can be processed again, while a "processed" event is ignored.
